- **Username** — the Nextcloud username with a **copy-to-clipboard** button
- **Password** — displayed according to the "Show password" product setting:
  - **Show button** — password is hidden by default, revealed when the user clicks the show button; copy-to-clipboard button is always available
  - **Plain text** — password is always visible in plain text; copy-to-clipboard button available
  - **No** — password is completely hidden with no option to reveal
